# SimpleImageViewerApp

This is a simple app to display any image, or directory of images easily and lightweight. It will show most formats. And with animated gifs, it will display the gifs animated. Right clicking will open a menu for you to Load the directory of images.  Also, you can choose to run a slideshow of those  images.  Double clicking on the picture will make it full screen. Escape will reduce to normal size and close program.
